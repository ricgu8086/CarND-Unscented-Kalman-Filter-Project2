After completing the assignment and test my code with the simulator (see Figure 1 below), I verify that my results meet the acceptance criteria:

> Your px, py, vx, and vy RMSE should be less than or equal to the values [.09, .10, .40, .30]. 

My accuracy (in RMSE terms):

- 0.0781302 < .09 ✓
- 0.0818053 < .10 ✓
- 0.316293 < .40 ✓
- 0.292331 < .30 ✓
